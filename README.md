# Hey_Day_Script_Aldaz

This activity serves a reminder of one of Auburn's greatest traditions, **Hey Day**!
This tradition began back several decades ago, as veterans from World War 2 were having trouble reintegrating themselves back into a normal lifestyle. Many individuals felt invisible, given what they had just gone through. Therefore, **Hey Day** was created! A tradition of taking time to say "Hey" to both your friends and to your peers on campus, as a way to commemorate their service.
